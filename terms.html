<b>TERMS OF SITE USAGE AND GENERAL TERMS</b><br>

The following Terms and Conditions may be updated from time to time without notice. This website, PSDWORDPRESS (the “Site”) may, from time to time, offer and promote services other than this Site, which services may be governed by different Terms and Conditions.<br>

<b>TERMS OF SERVICE USAGE</b><br>

We currently offer special flat rates for front-end development projects for the new clients based on the rates of $35 - $45 / hour depending on the complexity of the project and the skills required to accomplish it.
Additional charges may apply depending on the project complexity (e.g. in the case of single-page sites with complex UI / UX, infinite scrolling or web pages longer than 2000px). We reserve the right to amend our pricing for any changes or additions to the project subsequent to our commencement of the project. We also reserve the right to revise the quote or refuse to work on a project and issue a refund in case an actual scope of work required for the project completion substantially exceeds the flat rate amount paid.
Expedited delivery service is available for extra charge.<br>

<b>DELIVERY TIMELINES</b><br>
The standard turnaround time for the first page of non-responsive HTML / CSS layout usually takes 6 working hours and 9 hours for the responsive one.
Each additional / inner page associated with the same project generally takes 3-4 working hours, depending on the complexity and specifications of the project.
The delivery timeline takes effect at the time that (1) payment has been made for the order and (2) the order details have been accepted and agreed upon by the parties.<br>

<b>FIXES / UPDATES AND POST-DELIVERY SUPPORT</b><br>
All further updates are charged at forty (40) USD per hour.<br>

<b>REFUND POLICY</b><br>
A full refund will be considered based on the following reasons:
the client’s request to cancel the order is received before the development is started;
A partial refund will be considered based on the following reasons:
the client is not reasonably and legitimately satisfied with the quality of the code.<br>

<b>PAYMENT</b><br>
Payments will be charged on a prepay basis on the day that the order is created. Refunds are provided under certain circumstances, as set forth in paragraph “REFUND POLICY” of this Terms of Service Agreement.
